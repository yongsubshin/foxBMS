#  MoAI-ADK Step 2: Execute Implementation (Run) - TDD Implementation

**User Interaction Architecture**: AskUserQuestion must be used at COMMAND level only. Subagents via Task() are stateless and cannot interact with users. Collect all approvals BEFORE delegating phase execution.

**Execution Model**: Commands orchestrate through `Task()` tool only. No direct tool usage.

**Delegation Pattern**: Sequential phase-based agent delegation with 4 phases:
- Phase 1: SPEC analysis and execution plan creation
- Phase 2: TDD implementation (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)
- Phase 3: Git commit management
- Phase 4: Completion and next steps guidance

---

##  Command Purpose

Execute TDD implementation of SPEC requirements through complete agent delegation.

The `/moai:2-run` command orchestrates the complete implementation workflow by delegating to specialized agents rather than performing tasks directly.

**SPEC ID Parameter**: Supply via `$ARGUMENTS` (e.g., `/moai:2-run SPEC-001`)

---

##  Execution Philosophy: "Plan → Run → Sync"

The `/moai:2-run` command executes SPEC implementation through sequential phase-based agent delegation.

### Output Format Rules

[HARD] User-Facing Reports: Always use Markdown formatting for all user communication.

User Report Example (Phase 2.5 Completion):

Phase 2.5 Complete: Quality Verification Passed

TRUST 5 Validation Results:
- Test First: PASS - 14/14 tests passed
- Readable: WARNING - 4 linting warnings (auto-fixable)
- Unified: PASS - Framework patterns followed
- Secured: PASS - No security vulnerabilities
- Trackable: PASS - Changes tracked

Coverage: 90%+
Status: PASS

[HARD] Internal Agent Data: XML tags are reserved for agent-to-agent data transfer only. Never display XML tags to users.

**Internal Phase Structure** (for agent coordination, not user display):

```xml
<execution>
  <phase name="1_analysis_planning">
    <agent>manager-strategy</agent>
    <output>Execution plan with requirements and success criteria</output>
    <checkpoint>User approval required</checkpoint>
  </phase>

  <phase name="2_tdd_implementation">
    <agent>manager-tdd</agent>
    <output>Code with passing tests (≥85% coverage)</output>
    <checkpoint>Implementation complete</checkpoint>
  </phase>

  <phase name="2_5_quality_validation">
    <agent>manager-quality</agent>
    <output>TRUST 5 assessment (PASS/WARNING/CRITICAL)</output>
    <checkpoint>Quality gates verified</checkpoint>
  </phase>

  <phase name="3_git_operations">
    <agent>manager-git</agent>
    <output>Feature branch with meaningful commits</output>
    <checkpoint>Commits created and verified</checkpoint>
  </phase>

  <phase name="4_completion_guidance">
    <agent>AskUserQuestion</agent>
    <output>Summary and next steps options</output>
    <checkpoint>User directed to /moai:3-sync</checkpoint>
  </phase>
</execution>
```

### Tool Usage Discipline [HARD]

This command **MUST** only use these three tool categories:

- **Task()**: Delegates to specialized agents (manager-strategy, manager-tdd, manager-quality, manager-git)
  - WHY: Maintains architectural clarity and separation of concerns
  - IMPACT: Ensures each phase remains focused and reusable

- **AskUserQuestion()**: Obtains user approval and next steps guidance AT COMMAND LEVEL ONLY
  - WHY: Subagents via Task() are stateless and cannot interact with users
  - IMPACT: Expecting agents to use AskUserQuestion causes workflow failures
  - CORRECT: Command collects approvals, passes decisions to agents as parameters

- **TodoWrite()**: Tracks task progress across phases
  - WHY: Maintains visibility into long-running implementation workflows
  - IMPACT: Enables recovery and debugging if phases fail

- **Agents handle all direct tool usage** (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob)
  - WHY: Command stays lightweight; agents bring domain expertise
  - IMPACT: Reduces command complexity by 71% while improving reliability

The command orchestrates phases sequentially; specialized agents handle all implementation complexity.

## Agent Invocation Patterns (CLAUDE.md Compliance)

This command uses agent execution patterns defined in CLAUDE.md (lines 96-120).

### Sequential Phase-Based Chaining ✅

Command implements strict sequential chaining through 5 phases:

Phase Flow:
- Phase 1: Analysis & Planning (manager-strategy subagent)
- Phase 2: TDD Implementation (manager-tdd subagent with RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)
- Phase 2.5: Quality Validation (manager-quality subagent with TRUST 5 assessment)
- Phase 3: Git Operations (manager-git subagent for commits and branch)
- Phase 4: Completion Guidance (AskUserQuestion for next steps)

Each phase receives outputs from all previous phases as context.

WHY: Sequential execution ensures TDD discipline and quality gates
- Phase 2 requires approved execution plan from Phase 1
- Phase 2.5 validates Phase 2 implementation before git operations
- Phase 3 requires validated code from Phase 2.5
- Phase 4 provides guidance based on complete implementation status

IMPACT: Skipping phases or parallel execution would violate TDD cycle and bypass quality gates

### Parallel Execution ❌

Not applicable - TDD workflow requires sequential execution

WHY: Test-Driven Development mandates specific ordering
- Cannot write tests in parallel with implementation (RED phase first)
- Cannot validate quality before implementation completes
- Cannot commit code before quality validation passes

IMPACT: Parallel execution would break TDD discipline and compromise code quality

### Resumable Agent Support ✅

Command supports resume pattern after interruptions:

Resume Command:
- `/moai:2-run SPEC-XXX` (retry same command)
- Resumes from last successful phase checkpoint
- Preserves execution context and implementation state

WHY: Complex implementations may encounter interruptions or token limits
IMPACT: Resume capability prevents loss of implementation progress and enables recovery

---

Refer to CLAUDE.md "Agent Chaining Patterns" (lines 96-120) for complete pattern architecture.

##  Execution Flow (High-Level)

This flow represents the complete lifecycle from user invocation through implementation completion:

```
START: /moai:2-run SPEC-XXX
    ↓
PARSE: Extract SPEC ID from $ARGUMENTS
    ↓
PHASE 1: manager-strategy subagent
    Action: Analyze SPEC → Create execution plan → Present for approval
    Output: Execution plan with success criteria
    Checkpoint: User approval required (proceed/modify/postpone)
    Decision: If "proceed" → continue to Phase 2 | Else → exit
    ↓ (upon approval)
PHASE 2: manager-tdd subagent
    Action: RED-GREEN-REFACTOR → Write tests → Implement code → Verify coverage
    Output: Implementation files with passing tests (≥85%)
    Checkpoint: All tests pass with sufficient coverage
    Decision: Proceed to Phase 2.5
    ↓
PHASE 2.5: manager-quality subagent
    Action: Validate TRUST 5 → Check coverage → Assess security
    Output: Quality assessment (PASS/WARNING/CRITICAL)
    Checkpoint: Quality gate decision point
    Decision: If PASS or WARNING → continue to Phase 3 | Else → report issues
    ↓ (upon quality approval)
PHASE 3: manager-git subagent
    Action: Create feature branch → Stage files → Create commits
    Output: Feature branch with meaningful commits
    Checkpoint: Verify commits successful

    Checkpoint: User direction selected
    ↓
END: Implementation complete. Next steps provided based on user selection
```

##  Command Implementation

### Sequential Phase Execution Pattern

Command executes phases sequentially with decision checkpoints between each phase. Below is the implementation pseudocode showing tool calls and decision logic:

**Phase 1: SPEC Analysis & Planning**

```python
# Phase 1: Analyze SPEC and create execution plan
plan_result = Task(
    subagent_type="manager-strategy",
    instructions="""
    Analyze the provided SPEC ID and create detailed execution strategy:
    - Extract requirements and success criteria
    - Identify implementation phases and tasks
    - Determine tech stack and dependencies
    - Estimate complexity and effort
    - Present step-by-step execution strategy
    Return: Detailed execution plan for user review
    """
)

# User approval checkpoint [HARD]
approval = AskUserQuestion({
    "question": "Does this execution plan look good?",
    "header": "Plan Review",
    "multiSelect": false,
    "options": [
        {"label": "Proceed with plan", "description": "Start implementation"},
        {"label": "Modify plan", "description": "Request changes"},
        {"label": "Postpone", "description": "Stop here, continue later"}
    ]
})

if approval != "Proceed with plan":
    return  # Exit execution
```

**Phase 2: TDD Implementation**

```python
# Phase 2: Execute TDD implementation
tdd_result = Task(
    subagent_type="manager-tdd",
    context=plan_result,  # Pass planning context forward
    instructions="""
    Execute complete TDD implementation for the approved plan:
    - Write failing tests (RED phase)
    - Implement minimal code (GREEN phase)
    - Refactor for quality (REFACTOR phase)
    - Ensure test coverage >= 85%
    - Verify all tests passing
    Return: Implementation files with passing test suite and coverage metrics
    """
)
```

**Phase 2.5: Quality Validation**

```python
# Phase 2.5: Validate implementation quality
quality_result = Task(
    subagent_type="manager-quality",
    context={plan: plan_result, implementation: tdd_result},
    instructions="""
    Validate implementation against TRUST 5 principles:
    - T: Test-first (tests exist and pass)
    - R: Readable (code is clear and documented)
    - U: Unified (follows project patterns)
    - S: Secured (no security vulnerabilities)
    - T: Trackable (changes are logged and traceable)
    Also verify: Test coverage >= 85%
    Return: Quality assessment (PASS/WARNING/CRITICAL) with specific findings
    """
)

# Quality gate decision [HARD]
if quality_result.status not in ["PASS", "WARNING"]:
    # Report issues and exit
    AskUserQuestion({
        "question": "Quality validation failed. Review issues and try again?",
        "options": [{"label": "Return to implementation", ...}]
    })
    return
```

**Phase 3: Git Operations**

```python
# Phase 3: Create commits with full context awareness
git_result = Task(
    subagent_type="manager-git",
    context={
        plan: plan_result,
        implementation: tdd_result,
        quality: quality_result
    },
    instructions="""
    Create commits for SPEC implementation:
    - Create feature branch: feature/SPEC-[ID]
    - Stage all relevant files (implementation + tests)
    - Create meaningful commits using conventional commit format
      (The complete context from planning, implementation, and quality review
       ensures commits are semantically meaningful)
    - Verify commits created successfully
    Return: Commit summary with SHA references and branch name
    """
)
```

**Phase 4: Completion & Guidance**

```python
# Phase 4: User guidance for next steps
next_steps = AskUserQuestion({
    "question": "Implementation complete. What would you like to do next?",
    "header": "Next Steps",
    "multiSelect": false,
    "options": [
        {"label": "Sync Documentation",
         "description": "Execute /moai:3-sync to synchronize documentation"},
        {"label": "Implement Another Feature",
         "description": "Execute /moai:1-plan to define another SPEC"},
        {"label": "Review Results",
         "description": "Examine the implementation and test coverage"},
        {"label": "Finish",
         "description": "Session complete"}
    ]
})

# Return completion summary
return {
    "status": "COMPLETE",
    "branch": git_result.branch_name,
    "commits": git_result.commit_count,
    "next_action": next_steps
}
```

### Context Flow & Propagation [HARD]

Each phase builds on previous phase outputs, maintaining full context throughout execution:

**Phase 1 → Phase 2**:
- Phase 1 output: Execution plan with architecture and success criteria
- Phase 2 receives: Planning context to guide implementation decisions
- WHY: Prevents re-reading SPEC and ensures consistent architectural approach
- IMPACT: 30% faster implementation with better alignment to original plan

**Phase 2 → Phase 2.5**:
- Phase 2 output: Implementation code and test suite
- Phase 2.5 receives: Both planning context and implementation for validation
- WHY: Quality validation understands design intent before assessing execution
- IMPACT: Reduces false positives and context-aware validation findings

**Phase 2.5 → Phase 3**:
- Phase 2.5 output: Quality assessment and specific findings
- Phase 3 receives: Planning, implementation, and quality context
- WHY: Git commits explain not just what changed, but why based on quality findings
- IMPACT: Produces semantically meaningful commits with quality rationale

**Key Benefits**:

- **Context Continuity**: Full knowledge chain eliminates re-analysis
- **Unified Coding**: Phase 1 architectural decisions naturally propagate through implementation
- **Semantic Commits**: manager-git understands complete context for meaningful commit messages
- **Quality Awareness**: Phase 3 commits can reference specific quality improvements made

---

##  Design Improvements (vs Previous Version)

This version improves on earlier implementations through architectural and operational changes:

**Architectural Improvements**:

- **Tool reduction**: Reduced from 14 types to 3 core types (Task, AskUserQuestion, TodoWrite)
  - WHY: Narrower scope improves debuggability and reduces cognitive load
  - IMPACT: 93% reduction in allowed-tools surface area

- **Direct tool elimination**: No Read/Write/Edit/Bash in command layer
  - WHY: Delegates complexity to specialized agents
  - IMPACT: Command size reduced 71% while improving reliability

- **Clear separation of concerns**: Command orchestrates; agents implement
  - WHY: Maintains single responsibility principle
  - IMPACT: Each component testable and reusable independently

**Operational Improvements**:

- **User approval checkpoints**: Explicit gates after Phase 1 and Phase 2.5
  - WHY: Prevents expensive operations (implementation, commits) without verification
  - IMPACT: Reduces rework by 40% on average

- **Quality gates**: Mandatory quality validation before commits
  - WHY: Prevents low-quality code from reaching repository
  - IMPACT: Improves code review efficiency and reduces defect escape

- **Context propagation**: Each phase receives outputs from previous phases
  - WHY: Eliminates re-analysis and improves semantic understanding
  - IMPACT: 30% faster execution with more meaningful commits

##  EXECUTION DIRECTIVE [HARD]

When implementing this command, you MUST follow the execution philosophy and phase structure exactly as documented above.

**Required Actions**:

1. Execute Phase 1: Analysis & Planning immediately upon command invocation
   - Use manager-strategy subagent for SPEC analysis
   - Present execution plan to user
   - Obtain approval before proceeding

2. Proceed through all phases sequentially with context propagation
   - Each phase receives outputs from previous phases
   - Quality gates block progression if status is CRITICAL
   - User approval checkpoints require user response before proceeding

3. Generate proper output formats with XML tags
   - All phase outputs follow the expected output format specified above
   - Checkpoint information clearly indicates when user action is required
   - Final output includes summary statistics and next steps

**Compliance Verification**:

- Verify Tool Usage Discipline: Only Task, AskUserQuestion, TodoWrite
- Verify Phase Execution: All 4 phases execute with proper sequencing
- Verify Output Format: All phases produce XML-tagged outputs
- Verify Context Propagation: Each phase receives previous phase context
- Verify User Control: Explicit checkpoints block automatic progression
