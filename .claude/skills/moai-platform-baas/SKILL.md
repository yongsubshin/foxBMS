# moai-platform-baas: Comprehensive BaaS Integration Hub

## Quick Reference (30 seconds)

Enterprise BaaS Provider Unification: One skill to manage authentication, database, and deployment across 9 major BaaS providers with AI-powered provider selection, cross-provider integration patterns, and automated migration assistance.

### Core Provider Matrix

| Category | Providers | Key Strength |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| Authentication | Auth0, Clerk, Firebase Auth | SSO, Modern Auth, Google Integration |
| Database | Supabase, Neon, Convex, Firestore | PostgreSQL 16, Serverless, Real-time |
| Deployment | Vercel, Railway | Edge Optimization, Full-stack |

### Key Capabilities
- AI Provider Selection: Automatically choose optimal providers based on requirements
- Cross-Provider Integration: Seamless setup between auth, database, and deployment
- Migration Guides: Step-by-step migration between any providers
- Production Patterns: Enterprise-ready configurations and security
- Cost Optimization: Provider-specific cost analysis and recommendations
- Context7 Integration: Latest API documentation and best practices

### When to Use
- New Project: AI-driven provider selection for optimal stack
- Migration: Smooth transition between BaaS providers
- Multi-Provider: Complex integrations across different services
- Cost Optimization: Analyze and reduce BaaS infrastructure costs
- Security Audits: Ensure compliance across all providers

### Quick Provider Selection
```python
# AI-powered provider recommendation
ai_selector = BaaSProviderSelector()
recommendation = ai_selector.select_optimal_stack({
 "requirements": ["scalable", "real-time", "enterprise"],
 "tech_stack": "Next.js",
 "team_size": 5,
 "budget": "$500/month"
})
# Returns: { auth: "Clerk", database: "Supabase", deployment: "Vercel" }
```

## Implementation Guide

### Phase 1: AI Provider Selection & Setup

Requirements Analysis & Provider Selection:
```python
async def analyze_baas_requirements(project_context: ProjectContext) -> ProviderRecommendation:
 """AI-powered provider selection based on project requirements."""
 
 # Get latest Context7 documentation for all providers
 context7_docs = await fetch_all_provider_docs()
 
 # Analyze requirements against provider capabilities
 analysis = ProviderAnalyzer().analyze_requirements(project_context, context7_docs)
 
 # Generate weighted recommendation
 return ProviderRecommender().generate_recommendation(analysis)
```

Unified Provider Configuration:
```python
# Unified provider setup (works for all 9 providers)
provider_manager = UnifiedBaaSManager()

# Authentication setup
auth_config = provider_manager.configure_auth({
 "provider": "clerk", # or "auth0", "firebase-auth"
 "features": ["social_auth", "mfa", "organizations"]
})

# Database setup 
db_config = provider_manager.configure_database({
 "provider": "supabase", # or "neon", "convex", "firestore"
 "schema_path": "./schema.sql",
 "migrations": True
})

# Deployment setup
deploy_config = provider_manager.configure_deployment({
 "provider": "vercel", # or "railway"
 "framework": "nextjs",
 "environment": "production"
})
```

### Phase 2: Authentication Providers

Auth0 (Enterprise SSO Focus):
- Enterprise SSO with 50+ connections (SAML, OIDC, ADFS)
- B2B SaaS with organizations and RBAC
- Custom database connections and advanced security

Clerk (Modern Auth Focus):
- Modern WebAuthn and passkey support
- Built-in organization management
- Multi-platform SDKs and beautiful UI components

Firebase Auth (Google Integration):
- Deep Google services integration
- Firebase Analytics and Cloud Functions
- Mobile-first design with Google Cloud integration

### Phase 3: Database Providers

Supabase (PostgreSQL 16+ Focus):
- PostgreSQL 16 with pgvector and AI extensions
- Row-Level Security for multi-tenant apps
- Real-time subscriptions and Edge Functions

Neon (Serverless PostgreSQL):
- Auto-scaling serverless PostgreSQL
- Instant database branching
- 30-day Point-in-Time Recovery

Convex (Real-time Backend):
- Real-time reactive queries and optimistic updates
- Instant database branching for development
- TypeScript-first design with built-in caching

Firebase Firestore (Mobile Focus):
- Real-time synchronization with offline caching
- Mobile-first SDKs for iOS and Android
- Google ecosystem integration

### Phase 4: Deployment Platforms

Vercel (Edge Deployment):
- Global edge network with Next.js optimization
- Edge Functions and zero-config deployments
- Analytics and built-in observability

Railway (Full-stack Containers):
- Full-stack container deployment with Docker
- Multi-region support and built-in CI/CD
- Environment variables management

### Phase 5: Cross-Provider Integration

Modern Web Stack (Vercel + Clerk + Supabase):
```python
class ModernWebStack:
 """Vercel + Clerk + Supabase integration."""
 
 def setup_integration(self):
 """Seamless integration setup."""
 return {
 "authentication": "clerk",
 "database": "supabase", 
 "deployment": "vercel",
 "real_time_features": True,
 "server_functions": True,
 "edge_optimization": True
 }
```

Enterprise Stack (Auth0 + Supabase + Vercel):
- Enterprise SSO with 50+ connections
- PostgreSQL 16 with Row-Level Security
- Global edge performance

Real-time Stack (Clerk + Convex + Vercel):
- Modern authentication with organizations
- Real-time collaborative features
- Edge performance for global users

## Provider Selection Decision Trees

### Authentication Provider Selection
```
Need Enterprise SSO with 50+ connections?
 YES → Auth0 (Enterprise grade)
 B2B SaaS focus? → Auth0 Organizations
 General enterprise? → Auth0 Enterprise
 NO → Need modern WebAuthn?
 YES → Clerk (Passwordless)
 Organizations needed? → Clerk Pro
 Simple auth only? → Clerk Starter
 NO → Google ecosystem integration?
 YES → Firebase Auth
 NO → Clerk (default)
```

### Database Provider Selection
```
